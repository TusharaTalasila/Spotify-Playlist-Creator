# Spotify-Playlist-Creator
A machine learning engine coded in Python. The engine uses a content-based recommendation system to generate recommendations. This engine utilizes the Spotify API as well as the Scikit-Learn library to generate song recommendations for users based on their past Spotify Playlists. Users are able to specify which playlist in their library, that they want the song recommendations to be based off. This engine is part of an ongoing project of mine to create an app that creates customizable playlists for Spotify users and automatically adds them to their Spotify libraries.
