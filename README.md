# Spotify-Playlist-Creator
A machine learning engine coded in Python. This engine utilizes the Spotify API as well as Skikit-Learn library to generate song recomendations for users based on their past Spotify Playlists. Users are able to specify which playlist in their library, that they want the song recomendations to be based off. This engine is part of an ongoing project of mine to create an app that creates customizable playlists for Spotify users and adds them to their Spotify Library automatically.
